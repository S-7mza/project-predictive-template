How to Use This Predictive Project Playbook

Audience
- Project managers, product owners, and tech leads running predictive analysis / ML projects.

1. Start with framing and governance
- Read `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` and `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER (C).md` to clarify objectives, scope, and stakeholders.
- Skim `docs/PROJECT_PLAN (C).md` to understand phases and governance, including reporting and change control.

2. Plan workshops and communications
- Use `00_WORKSHOP_TIMEPLAN (C).md` to see the end-to-end schedule of workshops.
- For each workshop, open the matching agenda in `workshops/` and communication plan in `communication/`.
- Invite the right people and send pre-work using `templates/EMAIL_INVITES.md`.

3. Set up Agile delivery
- In the `agile/` folder, read `SPRINT_PLANNING.md`, `DAILY_STANDUP.md`, `SPRINT_REVIEW.md`, and `RETROSPECTIVE.md`.
- Agree on a sprint cadence, then use `agile/SPRINT_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.csv`, `agile/BURNDOWN_TEMPLATE.csv`, and `agile/VELOCITY_TRACKER.csv`.
- Share `agile/PRODUCT_OWNER_GUIDE.md` with the Product Owner.

4. Use templates while you go
- For decisions, actions, issues, and risks, use `templates/DECISION_LOG.md`, `ACTION_LOG.csv`, `ISSUE_LOG.md`, and `RISK_REGISTER.md`.
- For scope changes, use `templates/CHANGE_REQUEST.md`.
- For status reporting, copy `templates/STATUS_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` and update it on your chosen cadence.

5. Keep quality, validation, and deployment in view
- Read `docs/QUALITY_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md` and `docs/TEST_UAT_PLAN (C).md` early.
- Use `docs/MONITORING_SLO_CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` when planning go-live.

6. Track benefits and improve the process
- Capture benefits in `docs/BENEFITS_REALIZATION.md` and `docs/BENEFITS_TRACKER.csv`.
- Track basic process metrics in `docs/PROCESS_METRICS.md`.
- After each project, add 2–3 key lessons into `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` and adjust your use of the playbook accordingly.
