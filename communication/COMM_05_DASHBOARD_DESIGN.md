# Communication Plan – Workshop 5: Dashboard Design (UX + BI)

This plan focuses on communication around the **Dashboard Design (UX + BI)** workshop so that business users, designers, and technical teams are aligned on look & feel, content, and usability.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Lifecycle role: design **model consumption UX** (dashboards/apps/reports) so that predictions are surfaced in a way that supports decisions and testing in later QA/UAT.
- Align on **user journeys**, **personas**, and **key use cases** for consuming model outputs.
- Define **layout, navigation, and visual standards** (colors, typography, interaction patterns).
- Agree on **prioritized views** (landing page, detail pages, drill-downs).
- Capture UX decisions and constraints to guide build, QA, and future iterations.

---

## 2. Stakeholder Groups

- **Tech Manager** (ensures feasibility, alignment with technical constraints)
- **UX / UI Designer**
- **BI Developer / Dashboard Engineer**
- **Product Owner / Business SMEs**
  
- **Representative end-users** (if possible)

---

## 3. Timeline & Touchpoints

- **T–7 to T–5:** Invite with context, initial personas, and objectives.
- **T–3:** Agenda + pre-work (review existing dashboards, gather examples, draft wireframes if available).
- **T–0 morning:** Reminder focusing on participation and examples.
- **T+0 / T+1:** Recap + design decisions + link to mockups / wireframes.
- **T+3:** Optional follow-up for feedback on refined designs.

## 8. What to Check for a “Perfect” Model Consumption UX Communication Plan

To make this communication stream as strong as possible, ensure that:

- **Users are represented:** Invitations include real or proxy **end-users**, not only managers, so we design how predictions are actually consumed.
- **Pre-work is meaningful:** Participants know which examples to bring and what problems they are trying to solve.
- **Decisions are visible:** Recap clearly lists UX decisions (layouts, navigation, visual rules) and open items.
- **Artifacts are accessible:** Wireframes, mockups, and VIS specs are linked in recap emails and easy to find.
- **Scope is under control:** Communication makes clear what will be delivered in MVP vs. later phases and how this ties into upcoming **QA/UAT** and **benefits tracking**.
- **Feedback loop exists:** There is explicit space for users to **react to designs** before build is frozen.

If these points are addressed, dashboard design communication will support adoption and reduce rework.
