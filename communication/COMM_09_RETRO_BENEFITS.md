## 5. Pre-Workshop Email – Pre-reads & Focus Questions (T–2)

**From:** Sponsor  
**To:** Confirmed participants  
**Subject:** `[Predictive Analysis Project] Retrospective & Benefits Review – prep & material`

Hi all,

Ahead of our **Retrospective & Benefits Review** (Week 8), please review the following:

- Benefits tracker: `docs/BENEFITS_TRACKER.csv`  
- Benefits narrative: `docs/BENEFITS_REALIZATION.md`  
- Key incidents / issues logged during the project.

To structure the discussion in lifecycle terms, consider:
- What worked particularly well across data, modeling, deployment, and adoption?  
- What slowed us down or created frustration at each phase?  
- Which benefits (linked to model usage and predictions) are clearly visible today? Which are lagging?  
- What would you change for the next model iteration, consumption UX, or release?

Thank you,  
Sponsor
