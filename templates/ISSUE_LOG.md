Issue Log

Use this log to capture project issues (unlike action items which are planned tasks). Update status regularly.

ID | Date | Issue | Impact | Severity (P0/P1/P2) | Owner | Status | Tech debt? (Y/N) | Resolution / Notes
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
1 | [DATE] | Data access denied for source X | High: blocks modeling | P0 | Data Owner | Open | N | Escalated to Sponsor on [date]

Guidance
- Record issue discovery date, impact and owner.
- Assign severity and escalate P0/P1 per the project's escalation path in `docs/PROJECT_CHARTER.md`.
- Tag structural or technical-debt issues using the "Tech debt?" column to support prioritization in sprints.
- Log issues raised from monitoring alerts and incidents here, then create or link follow-up actions in `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv`.
- Close with a resolution note and link to any related action items in `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv`.
