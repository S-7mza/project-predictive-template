Model Training & Experimentation — Agenda (detailed)

Duration: 90 minutes
Attendees: Product Owner, Data Science Lead, Data Scientists, Data/ML Engineers

1. Recap objectives & target metrics (10 min)
- Revisit business objectives, target variable(s), and success metrics (e.g., AUC, F1, RMSE, uplift).

2. Data & feature review (20 min)
- Review available features, data quality, and coverage across key segments.
- Confirm any new feature ideas and feasibility.

3. Experiment design (30 min)
- Agree on baseline models and candidate algorithms.
- Define experiment matrix (features, hyperparameters, training windows, sampling strategy).
- Decide how to split data (train/validation/test, time-based splits if needed).

4. Evaluation & comparison plan (20 min)
- Confirm primary and secondary metrics, including by segment.
- Define how results will be compared and documented.
- Align on thresholds for “good enough to move to validation/UAT”.

5. Next steps & ownership (10 min)
- Assign owners to experiments and expected timelines.
- Capture risks, dependencies, and required support (e.g., infra, data access).

Outputs
- Updated `deliverables/MODEL_SPEC (C).md` and experiment plan.
- Clear list of experiments with owners, due dates, and success criteria.
