Model Training & Experimentation — Pre-work Checklist

Send 3 working days before the session.

Required inputs
- Product owner: top 5 business questions the predictive model should help answer.
- Data scientists: initial hypotheses, baseline models or notebooks (if any).
- Data/ML engineers: mock or sampled training dataset (with target variable) for experimentation.

Required attendees
- Product owner, Data Scientists, Data/ML Engineers.

Attachments to include in invite
- `deliverables/MODEL_SPEC (C).md` (draft)
- `deliverables/DATA_INVENTORY (C).md`

Goals for the session
- Refine the problem framing, target variable(s), and prediction horizon.
- Agree on candidate algorithms, feature sets, and key evaluation metrics.
- Align on experiment plan (baselines, ablations, and comparison criteria).

Post-meeting outputs
- Updated `deliverables/MODEL_SPEC (C).md` with agreed modeling approach.
- Prioritized list of experiments and baselines with owners and timelines.
