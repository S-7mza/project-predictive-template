Feature Engineering / Data Modeling — Pre-work Checklist

Send 3–5 working days before the session.

Required inputs
- Completed outputs from Data & Feature Discovery: schemas, sample extracts, row counts, cardinalities.
- Proposed canonical definitions for primary entities (e.g., customer, account).
- Current questions/ambiguities about keys, grain, candidate features, and slowly changing dimensions.

Required attendees
- Data Science Lead, data scientist(s), data modeler, ETL/feature engineer, data owner, product owner (optional).

Attachments to include in invite
- `deliverables/DATA_INVENTORY (C).md`
- Draft `deliverables/MODEL_SPEC (C).md` entries

Goals for the session
- Agree canonical tables, primary keys, grain, and key feature families.
- Define dimensions, facts, and feature transformation rules for the model.
- Identify modeling and feature-engineering anti-patterns to avoid for performance and leakage.

Post-meeting outputs
- Draft feature/model diagram and agreed grain definitions.
- Owner-assigned tasks for building canonical tables, feature pipelines, and transformations.
