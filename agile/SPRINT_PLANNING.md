Sprint Planning Template

Purpose
- Agree sprint goal, select backlog items, confirm capacity and define acceptance criteria.

When
- At the start of each sprint (timebox: 1–2 hours for a 2-week sprint depending on team size).

Attendees
- Product Owner, Scrum Master (or facilitator), Development Team, optionally Data Owner / Architect for complex stories.

Preparation
- PO ensures backlog is ordered and top items are refined.
- Team reviews capacity and any leave/holidays.

Agenda
1. Sprint Goal: PO presents the objective for the sprint (5–10 minutes).
2. Capacity Check: Team confirms available capacity (10 minutes).
3. Story Selection: Pull items from backlog until capacity is filled — discuss any dependencies (30–60 minutes).
4. Tasking & Estimates: Break selected stories into tasks and confirm estimates (30–60 minutes).
5. Acceptance Criteria Review: Ensure each selected story has clear, testable acceptance criteria.
6. Risks & Blockers: Record known risks and mitigations; assign owners.
7. Final Commit: Team confirms sprint backlog and sprint goal.

Outputs
- Committed sprint backlog (update `agile/SPRINT_BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.csv`).
- Sprint goal and acceptance criteria recorded.
- Risks and owners noted in `templates/ACTION_LOG.csv` or meeting minutes.
- Optional: Capture simple flow metrics (stories completed, average cycle time, WIP) and review trends in retrospectives.

Notes
- Timebox discussions; defer deep design conversations to follow-up sessions with relevant stakeholders.
